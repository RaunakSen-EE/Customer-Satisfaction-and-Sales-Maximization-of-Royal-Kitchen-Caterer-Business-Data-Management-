Problem Statement
1 The rising cost of food supplies and raw materials is putting pressure on profit margins and pricing strategies for the restaurant. Since dietary restrictions have an impact on menu options and profitability, the business has a difficult time adapting to changing client preferences thereby impacting sales.
2 The restaurant is not achieving its full potential in terms of customer acquisition due to a lack of efficient marketing techniques and an internet presence.
